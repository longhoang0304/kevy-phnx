# Kevy Phnx
Build your own Key-Value Database

## Development Status
Working in progrss

## Motivation
Being tired of finding a Key-Value database for my specific needs. Redis? Missing good cluster support. Memcache? Eh, it's not as good as Redis. So, let's build a database that I can config it whatever I want.

## Build

```bash
cargo build
```

## Getting started
### Starting the server
```bash
./kevy-server
```

### Starting the client
```bash
./kevy-cli -h
```
